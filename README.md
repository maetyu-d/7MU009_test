## Heading2

The following is a list:

One way to add a link is an [inline-style link](https://www.google.com).

Or leave it empty and use the link text itself, like this: <https://www.google.com>.

This shows how to add an image:

Blocks of code are fenced by lines with three back-ticks ``` like this:

```code
line1;
line2;
line3;
line9999999999.
```

I find tables to be slightly tricky, but colons can be used to align columns:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |


Blockquotes can be handy:

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 
Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> More quote if needed.
