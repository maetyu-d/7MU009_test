## Heading2

*Italics* are created by putting * at the start and * at the end (no spaces) of the word or sentence/part of sentence that you want to italicise.

** at the start and ** and end of the word/sentence/part sentences creates **bold** type.

The following is a list:

- item1
- item2
- item3

One way to add a link is an [inline-style link](https://www.google.com).

Or leave it empty and use the link text itself, like this: <https://www.google.com>.

This shows how to add an image:

Blocks of code are fenced by lines with three back-ticks ``` like this:

line1;
line2;
line3;
line9999999999.
```

I find tables to be slightly tricky, but colons can be used to align columns:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |


Blockquotes can be handy. They use the greater than symbol > at the start of the quote:

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 
Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> More quote if needed.

Three or more of the following will create horizontal dividers:
